# Pathify

Route Planning Optimized

Pathify is a web-mapping service that enhances route efficiency for delivery drivers. Users can enter in destinations that they wish to visit and Pathify will produce a route with the shortest distance.

The dataset used is for the state of Colorado, USA, and contains over 400,000 nodes and 1 million edges. The project utilizes a Spring Boot backend and a React.js frontend. This app was made for the 2XB3 Final Group Project.

Since Heroku servers are generally idle when not in use, the app may take upto a few minutes to produce paths on the first attempt.
